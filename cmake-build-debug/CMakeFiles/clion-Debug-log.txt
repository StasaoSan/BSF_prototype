CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finduserver.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "userver", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "userver" with any
  of the following names:

    userverConfig.cmake
    userver-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "userver" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "userver_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "userver" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
